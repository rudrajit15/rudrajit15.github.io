This post is on the importance of having proper initialization while using alternating minimization for two variables, such that the objective function under consideration is convex in each variable individually but not jointly convex with respect to both variables.

Alternating minimization has been succesfully used for solving several non-convex problems such as matrix completion, dictionary learning, image deblurring, EM algorithm, matrix factorization, etc. However, there is relatively less work on providing conditions under which it can converge to the optimal solution or close to it.
