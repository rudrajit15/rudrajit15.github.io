This post contains some references for the relatively unknown (in my opinion) EVT among people who aren't statisticians but use it heavily (such as in machine learning).

The EVT basically states that the limiting distribution of the maximum or minimum of i.i.d random variables can be modelled by just 3 types of distributions, which are the Gumbel, Frechet and Weibull types, as long as their individual distributions obey certain conditions (which are obeyed for standard distributions that we usually deal with). It is in some ways the analogue of the central limit theorem (which is regarding the distribution of the sums of i.i.d random variables).

I'm writing about EVT here because until about a month ago, I had never heard about it but while working on my previous paper, I needed to deal with the maximum of $n$ i.i.d Chi-squared random variables and the usual approach of using
