This short post contains some references for the relatively unknown (in my opinion) EVT among people who aren't statisticians but use it heavily (such as in machine learning).

The EVT basically states that the limiting distribution of the maximum or minimum of i.i.d random variables can be modelled by just 3 types of distributions, which are the Gumbel, Frechet and Weibull types, as long as their individual distributions obey certain conditions (which are obeyed for standard distributions that we usually deal with). It is in some ways the analogue of the central limit theorem (which is regarding the distribution of the sums of i.i.d random variables).

I'm writing about EVT here because until about a month ago, I had never heard about it but while working on my previous paper, I needed to deal with the maximum of a significantly large number of i.i.d Chi-squared random variables and the EVT result came in really handy here. And this was after wasting a lot of time trying with the usual CDF of the max. of $n$ random variables, say each with CDF $F(.)$, which would be simply $F(.)^{n}$. The power of the EVT really captivated me and I thought it was worth mentioning it!

Coming to the references, the book "Modelling Extremal Events for Insurance and Finance" (yes finance!) by Paul Embrechts, Claudia Kl√ºppelberg, Thomas Mikosch contains several useful results related to EVT for several classse of distributions. Unfortunately obtaining a free and complete online version of this book might be difficult - it's available as Google Books but with several pages missing! There are also quite a few stack exchange discussions which one might find on the EVT useful such as this one - https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/450139/asymptotics-of-maxima-of-i-i-d-chi-square-random-variables
