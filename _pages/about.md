Hey there!

<!-- I'm a final year dual degree (combined bachelor's and master's degree) student in the Department of Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Bombay. I've worked under the guidance of Prof. Subhasis Chaudhuri on some theoretical/mathematical aspects of machine learning and deep learning for my final thesis. I've been awarded the Undergraduate Research Award (URA-03) for exceptional work in my final thesis.-->

<!-- My primary interests are the design of efficient (especially probabilistic) algorithms for machine learning problems with provable performance guarantees as well as the theoretical understanding of deep learning with respect to the learned representations, non-convex optimization, etc. Besides, I'm also interested in deep learning for computer vision, specifically unsupervised and semi-supervised methods.-->

<!-- In general, I like solving mathematical problems based on linear algebra, probability & statistics, optimization, etc. which are ubiquitous in machine learning. You can check out my CV [here]({{ site.url }}/assets/CV_3_page.pdf).-->

<!-- I'm moving to the University of Texas at Austin to pursue a PhD degree in Computer Science (beginning Fall 2019). I shall be working with Prof. Inderjit Dhillon.-->

<!-- Also, I'm a huge cricket lover (and a decent player too) as well as a passionate foodie-->

I'm a first year PhD student in the Computer Science Department of **UT Austin**. I'm fortunate to be advised by Prof. **Inderjit Dhillon** and co-advised by Prof. **Sujay Sanghavi**. My main research interest is the design of efficient and provable machine learning and deep learning algorithms. In general, I like solving mathematical problems based on linear algebra, probability & statistics, optimization, etc. which are ubiquitous in machine learning.

Previously, I was a dual degree (combined bachelor's and master's degree) student in the Department of Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology (**IIT**) **Bombay**. At IIT Bombay, I've worked under the guidance of Prof. **Subhasis Chaudhuri** on some probabilistically provable theoretical aspects of neural networks and algorithmic aspects of large-scale optimization for my final thesis. I was awarded the **Undergraduate Research Award** (URA-03) for exceptional work in my final thesis.

**<font size="+3">Internships</font>**

1. **Institute for Biomechanics, ETH Zürich, Switzerland** (May '17 - July '17) <br/>
    *Guide : Dr. Patrik Christen and Prof. Dr. Ralph Müller, D-HEST* <br/>
    * Proposed a stable linear model (with closed form solution) and a fuzzy boolean network for bone re-modelling. <br/>
    * Also developed an automated 2D-3D image registration framework for histology images from scratch. Devised an efficient       sampling strategy to obtain the 2D projection of the 3D image across any plane and a good cost function to deal with         the highly non-convex nature of the problem. <br/>
    
2. **Altisource Business Solutions Private Limited, Bengaluru, India** (May '16 - July '16) <br/>
    * Developed a notification system using Pagerduty and worked on the UI of the company’s monitoring dashboard built using       JBoss Dashbuilder. <br/>
      
I was also one of the very few undergraduates selected to attend the **PRAIRIE Artificial Intelligence Summer School** (<a href="https://project.inria.fr/paiss/" style="color: #0000FF">**PAISS**</a>) co-organized by Inria and NAVER LABS Europe in Grenoble, France during July 2018. Here I presented a poster (can be found <a href="https://github.com/rudrajit15/Existence-of-sparse-basis-for-deep-learning-kernels/blob/master/Inria_poster.pdf" style="color: #0000FF">here</a>) titled “**Existence of Sparse Basis for Deep Learning Kernels?**”.
