Hey there!

I'm a final year dual degree (combined bachelor's and master's degree) student in the Department of Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Bombay. I'm working under the guidance of Prof. Subhasis Chaudhuri on some algorithmic aspects of large scale optimization.

In general, I like solving mathematical problems based on linear algebra, probability & statistics, optimization, etc. which are ubiquitous in data science. 

I'm moving to the University of Texas at Austin to pursue a PhD degree in Computer Science (beginning Fall 2019). I shall be working with Prof. Inderjit Dhillon.
