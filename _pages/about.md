Howdy!

I'm a second year PhD student in the Computer Science Department of **UT Austin**. I'm fortunate to be advised by Prof. **Inderjit Dhillon** and Prof. **Sujay Sanghavi**. Broadly, I'm interested in the design of efficient and provable machine learning and deep learning algorithms. Specifically, my current research interests include large-scale optimization, federated learning, and machine learning theory.

Previously, I was a dual degree (combined bachelor's and master's degree) student in the Department of Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology (**IIT**) **Bombay**. At IIT Bombay, I've worked under the guidance of Prof. **Subhasis Chaudhuri** on some probabilistically provable theoretical aspects of neural networks and algorithmic aspects of large-scale optimization for my final thesis <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1gOwSCWhbJLVFN2K178Ujve-WxFv_VDdB">[link]</a>. I was awarded the **Undergraduate Research Award** (URA-03) for exceptional work in my final thesis.

**<font size="+3">Internships</font>**

1. **Institute for Biomechanics, ETH Zürich, Switzerland** (May '17 - July '17) <br/>
    *Guide : Dr. Patrik Christen and Prof. Dr. Ralph Müller, D-HEST* <br/>
    * Proposed a stable linear model (with closed form solution) and a fuzzy boolean network for bone re-modelling. <br/>
    * Also developed an automated 2D-3D image registration framework for histology images from scratch. Devised an efficient       sampling strategy to obtain the 2D projection of the 3D image across any plane and a good cost function to deal with         the highly non-convex nature of the problem. <br/>
    
2. **Altisource Business Solutions Private Limited, Bengaluru, India** (May '16 - July '16) <br/>
    * Developed a notification system using Pagerduty, a popular incident management software, and worked on the UI of the company’s monitoring dashboard built using JBoss Dashbuilder. <br/>
      
I was also one of the very few undergraduates selected to attend the **PRAIRIE Artificial Intelligence Summer School** (<a href="https://project.inria.fr/paiss/" style="color: #0000FF">**PAISS**</a>) co-organized by Inria and NAVER LABS Europe in Grenoble, France during July 2018. Here I presented a poster (can be found <a href="https://github.com/rudrajit15/Existence-of-sparse-basis-for-deep-learning-kernels/blob/master/Inria_poster.pdf" style="color: #0000FF">here</a>) titled “**Existence of Sparse Basis for Deep Learning Kernels?**”.
