Hey there!

I'm a final year dual degree (combined bachelor's and master's degree) student in the Department of Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Bombay. I've worked under the guidance of Prof. Subhasis Chaudhuri on some theoretical/mathematical aspects of machine learning and deep learning for my final thesis. I'll be receiving the Undergraduate Research Award (URA-03) for exceptional work in my final thesis.

My primary interests are the design of efficient (especially probabilistic) algorithms for machine learning problems with provable performance guarantees as well as the theoretical understanding of deep learning with respect to the learned representations, non-convex optimization, etc. Besides, I'm also interested in deep learning for computer vision, specifically unsupervised and semi-supervised methods.

In general, I like solving mathematical problems based on linear algebra, probability & statistics, optimization, etc. which are ubiquitous in machine learning. You can check out my CV [here]({{ site.url }}/assets/CV_3_page.pdf).

I'm moving to the University of Texas at Austin to pursue a PhD degree in Computer Science (beginning Fall 2019). I shall be working with Prof. Inderjit Dhillon.

Also, I'm a huge cricket lover (and a decent player too) as well as a passionate foodie!
