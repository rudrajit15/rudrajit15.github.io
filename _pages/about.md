Howdy!

I'm a fourth year PhD student in the Computer Science Department of **UT Austin**. I'm fortunate to be advised by Prof. **Inderjit Dhillon** and Prof. **Sujay Sanghavi**. Broadly, I'm interested in the design of efficient and provable algorithms for machine learning. Specifically, my current research interests include large-scale & robust optimization, federated learning and differentially private optimization. I was a research intern at Google in 2021 and an applied scientist intern at Amazon in 2020.

Previously, I was a dual degree (combined bachelor's and master's degree) student in the Department of Electrical Engineering, **Indian Institute of Technology** (**IIT**) **Bombay**. At IIT Bombay, I worked under the guidance of Prof. **Subhasis Chaudhuri** on some probabilistically provable theoretical aspects of neural networks and algorithmic aspects of large-scale optimization for my final thesis <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1gOwSCWhbJLVFN2K178Ujve-WxFv_VDdB">[link]</a>. I was awarded the Undergraduate Research Award (URA-03) for exceptional work in my final thesis.

You can check out my CV [here]({{ site.url }}/assets/CV.pdf).

**<font size="+3">Internships</font>**

* **Research Intern at Google (Virtual)** (June '21 - Aug '21) <br/>
    *Mentors: Zheng Xu, Satyen Kale and Tong Zhang* <br/>
    * Clipped gradient methods are commonly used in practice for improving convergence as well as for differentially private (DP) training. However, a sound theoretical understanding of these methods has been elusive. We are working on deriving better theory for (DP-)SGD with clipping via the lens of bias-variance tradeoff of a gradient estimator. <br/>

* **Applied Scientist Intern at Amazon Search (Virtual), Berkeley, USA** (May '20 - Aug '20) <br/>
    *Mentor: Dan Hill, Manager: Sujay Sanghavi* <br/>
    * Worked on customer-specific query correction by leveraging the "session data" (i.e. previous searches of the customer) using SOTA Transformer models. Our model generated better candidates than the production system. <br/>

* **Institute for Biomechanics, ETH Zürich, Switzerland** (May '17 - July '17) <br/>
    *Guide : Dr. Patrik Christen and Prof. Dr. Ralph Müller, D-HEST* <br/>
    * Proposed a stable linear model (with closed form solution) and a fuzzy boolean network for bone re-modeling. Also developed an automated 2D-3D image registration framework for histology images from scratch. <br/>
