Hey there,

I am a final year dual degree (B.Tech + M.Tech) student at Electrical Engineering (EE) Department, Indian Institue of Technology Bombay (IIT-B), Mumbai, India. I am currently working under the guidance of Prof. Subhasis Chaudhuri on the theoretical aspects of deep learning, specifically large scale optimisation for deep learning using probabilistic techniques.

My primary interests are in Computer Vision (specifically unsupervised or semi-supervised) and the theoretical understanding of deep learning with respect to optimisation as well as representational power.
